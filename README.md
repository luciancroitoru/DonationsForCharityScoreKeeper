# DonationsForCharityScoreKeeper

This app was created in order to help an organization raise funds for charity during music festivals through colaboration and competition. 

Rules of the game:
The members of the organization are divided in 2 teams Green Team (Team A), and Blue Team (Team B). 
Both teams can sell:
-water (for 1 eur)
-coffee (for 2 eur)
-lemonade (for 2 eur)
-biscuits (for 3 eur)
-super sandwich (for 5 eur)

The teams are evaluated based on:
total money raised by each team 
and total number of products sold by each team

The scores increase by pressing the buttons in the application. at the bottom of the app there are two buttons: one resets the scores,
the other displays a written message referring to a comparison between the scores of the two teams.

the first team to reach 500 eur raised or 200 products sold would win the game. However, for ease of testing the app,
the app will showcase the winner when a team reaches 100 eur raised or 40 products sold.

A message will be displayed announcing the winner.
